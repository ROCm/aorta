# Reproduce `consan-racy`

Sanitizer case `consan-racy` from run `2026-08-13-31718502485` of the AORTA sanitizer nightly. This directory is the run area for that one case: its report, the sanitizer output the verdict came from, and the provenance below. Its logs, recipe copy and inputs were pruned for falling outside the nightly's log-retention window. See `index.html` for every file actually published here.

## Run

- Commit: `68c980aa449f656a870923831f63a8aa34c145a3`
- Date: 2026-08-13
- Target: `gfx950`
- Class: guardrail (gated guardrail)
- Workflow run: https://github.com/ROCm/aorta/actions/runs/31718502485

## Observed

- Verdict: `fail`
- Execution: `complete`
- Findings: 64

## Run it yourself

First, the checkout this run used:

```
git clone https://github.com/ROCm/aorta && cd aorta
git checkout 68c980aa449f656a870923831f63a8aa34c145a3
pip install -e .
```

Then rebuild the CI-built fixtures, which are not published here (see 'Artifacts not published' below). Run these from the repo root, the directory the clone above leaves you in:

- fixtures/bin/consan_lds_race_2wave -- a host repro binary built from fixtures/repro/consan_lds_race_2wave.hip: `export PATH="${ROCM_PATH:-${ROCM_HOME:-/opt/rocm}}/lib/llvm/bin:${PATH}"`; `mkdir -p recipes/sanitizers/fixtures/bin`; `hipcc --offload-arch=gfx950 -O1 -g recipes/sanitizers/fixtures/repro/consan_lds_race_2wave.hip -o recipes/sanitizers/fixtures/bin/consan_lds_race_2wave`.

The exact invocations the nightly used are in .github/workflows/sanitizers-nightly.yml.

Set `ROCJITSU_PREBUILT` (unpacked rocjitsu bundle supplying rj_waitcheck and the ConSan hook) before running. `aorta` sets `HSA_TOOLS_LIB`, `HSA_TOOLS_DISABLE_REGISTER`, `RJ_CONSAN_MODE`, `RJ_CONSAN_POLICY` for you from the recipe's policy block.

Finally, the sweep itself:

```
aorta sweep run --recipe recipes/sanitizers/daily-consan-racy.yaml
```
