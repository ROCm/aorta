# Reproduce `consan-lds-dispatch`

Sanitizer case `consan-lds-dispatch` from run `2026-08-29T124958-33252284140` of the AORTA sanitizer nightly. This directory is the run area for that one case: its report, the sanitizer output the verdict came from, and the provenance below. Its logs, recipe copy and inputs were pruned for falling outside the nightly's log-retention window. See `index.html` for every file actually published here.

## Observed

- Verdict: `pass`
- Execution: `complete`
- Findings: 0

## Run it yourself

First, the checkout this run used:

```
git clone https://github.com/ROCm/aorta && cd aorta
git checkout e61f455a130bf266c83730ac055cd208efe0af87
pip install -e .
```

Then rebuild the CI-built fixtures, which are not published here (see 'Artifacts not published' below). Run these from the repo root, the directory the clone above leaves you in:

- fixtures/isa/lds.hsaco -- a gfx code object built from fixtures/kernels/lds_reduce.hip: `export PATH="$(python -c "from aorta.instrumentation.rocm_paths import resolve_rocm_roots; print(resolve_rocm_roots().llvm_bin_dir)"):${PATH}"`; `mkdir -p recipes/sanitizers/fixtures/isa`; `hipcc --genco --offload-arch=gfx950 recipes/sanitizers/fixtures/kernels/lds_reduce.hip -o tmp.o`; `if head -c 24 tmp.o | grep -qF __CLANG_OFFLOAD_BUNDLE__; then clang-offload-bundler --type=o --unbundle --input=tmp.o --targets=hipv4-amdgcn-amd-amdhsa--gfx950 --output=recipes/sanitizers/fixtures/isa/lds.hsaco; else cp tmp.o recipes/sanitizers/fixtures/isa/lds.hsaco; fi && rm -f tmp.o`. The conditional matters: --genco emits a raw code object on some ROCm builds and a clang-offload bundle on others, and the recorded digest is of the unbundled object.
- fixtures/bin/lds_dispatch -- a host repro binary built from fixtures/kernels/lds_dispatch.hip: `export PATH="$(python -c "from aorta.instrumentation.rocm_paths import resolve_rocm_roots; print(resolve_rocm_roots().llvm_bin_dir)"):${PATH}"`; `mkdir -p recipes/sanitizers/fixtures/bin`; `hipcc --offload-arch=gfx950 -DLDS_HSACO="\"$(pwd)/recipes/sanitizers/fixtures/isa/lds.hsaco\"" recipes/sanitizers/fixtures/kernels/lds_dispatch.hip -o recipes/sanitizers/fixtures/bin/lds_dispatch`. The -DLDS_HSACO define is required: it is how the binary learns which code object to load.

The exact invocations the nightly used are in .github/workflows/sanitizers-nightly.yml.

Set `ROCJITSU_PREBUILT` (unpacked rocjitsu bundle supplying rj_waitcheck and the ConSan hook) before running. `aorta` sets `HSA_TOOLS_LIB`, `HSA_TOOLS_DISABLE_REGISTER`, `RJ_CONSAN_MODE`, `RJ_CONSAN_POLICY` for you from the recipe's policy block.

Finally, the sweep itself:

```
aorta sweep run --recipe recipes/sanitizers/daily-consan-lds-dispatch.yaml
```
