# Reproduce `waitcheck-lds-dispatch`

Sanitizer case `waitcheck-lds-dispatch` from run `2026-08-24-32725903878` of the AORTA sanitizer nightly. This directory is the run area for that one case: its report, the sanitizer output the verdict came from, and the provenance below. See `index.html` for every file actually published here.

## Run

- Commit: `78d1ae686dc3a786e8cfdb1216efc4b7516c8896`
- Date: 2026-08-24
- Target: `gfx950`
- Class: survey (observed-only, non-gating)
- Workflow run: https://github.com/ROCm/aorta/actions/runs/32725903878
- Container image: `rocm/pytorch:rocm7.2.4_ubuntu24.04_py3.12_pytorch_release_2.10.0@sha256:4449f856653602317e4101a76fce599c7fcd58ccec2e539951fce5f73083179e`
- rocjitsu bundle: `ed35c0b54547c98bab359c8732529d9f5e8fd1ae` (https://github.com/ROCm/rocm-systems/actions/runs/31815941260)

## Observed

- Verdict: `pass`
- Execution: `complete`
- Findings: 0

## Run it yourself

First, the checkout this run used:

```
git clone https://github.com/ROCm/aorta && cd aorta
git checkout 78d1ae686dc3a786e8cfdb1216efc4b7516c8896
pip install -e .
```

Then rebuild the CI-built fixtures, which are not published here (see 'Artifacts not published' below). Run these from the repo root, the directory the clone above leaves you in:

- fixtures/isa/lds.hsaco -- a gfx code object built from fixtures/kernels/lds_reduce.hip: `export PATH="${ROCM_PATH:-${ROCM_HOME:-/opt/rocm}}/lib/llvm/bin:${PATH}"`; `mkdir -p recipes/sanitizers/fixtures/isa`; `hipcc --genco --offload-arch=gfx950 recipes/sanitizers/fixtures/kernels/lds_reduce.hip -o tmp.o`; `if head -c 24 tmp.o | grep -qF __CLANG_OFFLOAD_BUNDLE__; then clang-offload-bundler --type=o --unbundle --input=tmp.o --targets=hipv4-amdgcn-amd-amdhsa--gfx950 --output=recipes/sanitizers/fixtures/isa/lds.hsaco; else cp tmp.o recipes/sanitizers/fixtures/isa/lds.hsaco; fi && rm -f tmp.o`. The conditional matters: --genco emits a raw code object on some ROCm builds and a clang-offload bundle on others, and the recorded digest is of the unbundled object.

The exact invocations the nightly used are in .github/workflows/sanitizers-nightly.yml.

Set `ROCJITSU_PREBUILT` (unpacked rocjitsu bundle supplying rj_waitcheck and the ConSan hook) before running.

Finally, the sweep itself:

```
aorta sweep run --recipe recipes/sanitizers/daily-waitcheck-lds-dispatch.yaml
```

## Artifacts not published

These are CI-built and too large to publish for every retained run. Rebuild them as above and check the digest matches.
