# Reproduce `waitcheck-gemm`

Sanitizer case `waitcheck-gemm` from run `2026-09-24T142227-35998938187` of the AORTA sanitizer nightly. This directory is the run area for that one case: its report, the sanitizer output the verdict came from, and the provenance below. See `index.html` for every file actually published here.

## Run

- Commit: `fe7f92211b6254aa3f6da5b634931a41ca921413`
- Date: 2026-09-24 14:22:27 UTC
- Target: `gfx950`
- Class: survey (observed-only, non-gating)
- Workflow run: https://github.com/ROCm/aorta/actions/runs/35998938187
- Container image: `rocm/pytorch:rocm10.0_ubuntu26.04_py3.14_pytorch_release_2.13.0@sha256:3174cb7061d94c427da96c0edef4adea28046fa3f3b2ff3948dc4e995665ff8c`

## Observed

- Verdict: `warn`
- Execution: `complete`
- Findings: 32

## Run it yourself

First, the checkout this run used:

```
git clone https://github.com/ROCm/aorta && cd aorta
git checkout fe7f92211b6254aa3f6da5b634931a41ca921413
pip install -e .
```

Then rebuild the CI-built fixtures, which are not published here (see 'Artifacts not published' below). Run these from the repo root, the directory the clone above leaves you in:

- fixtures/isa/consan_gemm_f32.hsaco -- one representative heavy f32 SS GEMM code object: `export PATH="$(python -c "from aorta.instrumentation.rocm_paths import resolve_rocm_roots; print(resolve_rocm_roots().llvm_bin_dir)"):${PATH}"`; `export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="${LD_LIBRARY_PATH:+${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}:}$(python -c "import os; from aorta.instrumentation.rocm_paths import resolve_rocm_roots as r; x = r(); print(os.pathsep.join(dict.fromkeys([str(x.core_lib_dir), str(x.lib_dir)])))")"`; `mkdir -p recipes/sanitizers/fixtures/isa`; `python scripts/sanitizers/prepare_gemm_isa.py --csv recipes/sanitizers/fixtures/gemm_shapes_unique.csv --out recipes/sanitizers/fixtures/isa --top-n 0 --consan-object recipes/sanitizers/fixtures/isa/consan_gemm_f32.hsaco`. Extracted from the shipped Tensile libraries, never compiled from a .hip source.

The exact invocations the nightly used are in .github/workflows/sanitizers-nightly.yml.

Set `ROCJITSU_PREBUILT` (unpacked rocjitsu bundle supplying rj_waitcheck and the ConSan hook) before running.

Finally, the sweep itself:

```
aorta sweep run --recipe recipes/sanitizers/daily-waitcheck-gemm-object.yaml
```
