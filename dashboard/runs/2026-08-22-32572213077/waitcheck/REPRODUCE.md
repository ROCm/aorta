# Reproduce `waitcheck`

Sanitizer case `waitcheck` from run `2026-08-22-32572213077` of the AORTA sanitizer nightly. This directory is the run area for that one case: its report, the sanitizer output the verdict came from, and the provenance below. Its logs, recipe copy and inputs were pruned for falling outside the nightly's log-retention window. See `index.html` for every file actually published here.

## Run

- Commit: `78d1ae686dc3a786e8cfdb1216efc4b7516c8896`
- Date: 2026-08-22
- Target: `gfx950`
- Class: guardrail (gated guardrail)
- Workflow run: https://github.com/ROCm/aorta/actions/runs/32572213077
- Container image: `rocm/pytorch:rocm7.2.4_ubuntu24.04_py3.12_pytorch_release_2.10.0@sha256:4449f856653602317e4101a76fce599c7fcd58ccec2e539951fce5f73083179e`

## Observed

- Verdict: `warn`
- Execution: `complete`
- Findings: 64

## Run it yourself

First, the checkout this run used:

```
git clone https://github.com/ROCm/aorta && cd aorta
git checkout 78d1ae686dc3a786e8cfdb1216efc4b7516c8896
pip install -e .
```

Then rebuild the CI-built fixtures, which are not published here (see 'Artifacts not published' below). Run these from the repo root, the directory the clone above leaves you in:

- fixtures/isa -- the per-transpose f32 GEMM code objects (sol_<n>.hsaco): `export PATH="${ROCM_PATH:-${ROCM_HOME:-/opt/rocm}}/lib/llvm/bin:${PATH}"`; `mkdir -p recipes/sanitizers/fixtures/isa`; `python scripts/sanitizers/prepare_gemm_isa.py --csv recipes/sanitizers/fixtures/gemm_shapes_unique.csv --out recipes/sanitizers/fixtures/isa --top-n 3`. Extracted from the shipped Tensile libraries, never compiled from a .hip source.

The exact invocations the nightly used are in .github/workflows/sanitizers-nightly.yml.

Set `ROCJITSU_PREBUILT` (unpacked rocjitsu bundle supplying rj_waitcheck and the ConSan hook) before running.

Finally, the sweep itself:

```
aorta sweep run --recipe recipes/sanitizers/daily-waitcheck-gemm.yaml
```

## Artifacts not published

These are CI-built and too large to publish for every retained run. Rebuild them as above and check the digest matches.
