# Reproduce `consan-racy`

Sanitizer case `consan-racy` from run `2026-09-02T124713-33629901482` of the AORTA sanitizer nightly. This directory is the run area for that one case: its report, the sanitizer output the verdict came from, and the provenance below. See `index.html` for every file actually published here.

## Run

- Commit: `30dcc055cba8f7f335169014f9af090a83ba00bd`
- Date: 2026-09-02 12:47:13 UTC
- Target: `gfx950`
- Class: guardrail (gated guardrail)
- Workflow run: https://github.com/ROCm/aorta/actions/runs/33629901482

## Observed

- Verdict: `fail`
- Execution: `complete`
- Findings: 64

## Run it yourself

First, the checkout this run used:

```
git clone https://github.com/ROCm/aorta && cd aorta
git checkout 30dcc055cba8f7f335169014f9af090a83ba00bd
pip install -e .
```

Then rebuild the CI-built fixtures, which are not published here (see 'Artifacts not published' below). Run these from the repo root, the directory the clone above leaves you in:

- fixtures/bin/consan_lds_race_2wave -- a host repro binary built from fixtures/repro/consan_lds_race_2wave.hip: `export PATH="$(python -c "from aorta.instrumentation.rocm_paths import resolve_rocm_roots; print(resolve_rocm_roots().llvm_bin_dir)"):${PATH}"`; `export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="${LD_LIBRARY_PATH:+${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}:}$(python -c "import os; from aorta.instrumentation.rocm_paths import resolve_rocm_roots as r; x = r(); print(os.pathsep.join(dict.fromkeys([str(x.core_lib_dir), str(x.lib_dir)])))")"`; `mkdir -p recipes/sanitizers/fixtures/bin`; `hipcc --offload-arch=gfx950 -O1 -g recipes/sanitizers/fixtures/repro/consan_lds_race_2wave.hip -o recipes/sanitizers/fixtures/bin/consan_lds_race_2wave`.

The exact invocations the nightly used are in .github/workflows/sanitizers-nightly.yml.

Set `ROCJITSU_PREBUILT` (unpacked rocjitsu bundle supplying rj_waitcheck and the ConSan hook) before running. `aorta` sets `HSA_TOOLS_LIB`, `HSA_TOOLS_DISABLE_REGISTER`, `RJ_CONSAN_MODE`, `RJ_CONSAN_POLICY` for you from the recipe's policy block.

Finally, the sweep itself:

```
aorta sweep run --recipe recipes/sanitizers/daily-consan-racy.yaml
```
